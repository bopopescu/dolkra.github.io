## 1 Secrets of A Self-Made Millionaire

### The Greatest Money Making Asset That Will Make You A Fortune
It is this one single asset that will generate for you unlimited wealth. This asset is your mind, also known as your intellectual asset!

When you invest time and money to expand your knowledge and skills, especially your financial education, it will return you millions of dollars in income streams for the rest of your life!

The reason why I believe in this so much is because like many self-made millionaires, I started with nothing but a hunger for knowledge of how to create wealth. 

Today, over 90% of a company’s value is in its intellectual assets! 

Over 90% of your wealth is not what you have in your wallet or in the bank, it is the ideas that you have in your head! In the information age of today, one great idea can be worth a billion dollars. 

### If You Want to Get a 1000% Return on Your Investment You Must Do this...
When it comes to specific activities, stop reading, grab a pen and follow the instructions that I will give to you. I believe that in jotting down and doing, you will truly integrate the essence of what I am going to share with you.

If you have little or no background in finance and accounting, some of the later chapters on investments may seem a bit intimidating, but don’t worry, keep pushing yourself and you will master it in no time.

Statistics have shown that 72% of people who buy a book never complete it and less than 3% ever follow through by applying what they have learned. 

So, get pro-active as you read and you will begin to see doors and windows opening for you.

### My Journey as a Self-Made Millionaire

And I created all this wealth starting with virtually nothing but the ideas in my head... the same raw material that you too have been blessed with. I did it without a single dollar in inheritance, no bank loans or any external investments.

### So How Did I Achieve All This?

I would say that the greatest contributing factor was my very intense desire for success and wealth. It was this passionate desire that drove me to want to learn everything I could about the strategies of the rich. From the age of 15, I was obsessed with reading books on
success and wealth from authors like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, George Soros, Anthony Robbins, Zig Ziglar and many others. I would model the mindsets and strategies of these people and begin to take and apply every new technique I learned until I achieved the results I wanted.

**nothing**

He knew that hunger was the key to motivation and the only way to make me hungry was
to deprive me. 

**own**

This was when I first adopted the belief that ‘money equals freedom’. This is one of the single
most important beliefs that has been the driving force behind my motivation to make money.

Looking back, it was during those days that I learned how to overcome shyness and the fear
of rejection... two important traits of becoming rich.

That boosted my confidence, as I had to learn how to speak and entertain in front of crowds. 

That was for free but that gave me the confidence and idea that I could start charging for my magic shows. 

It was at this camp that I was first exposed to the concept of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Accelerated Learning. I learned about the power of human potential and how anyone, with the right strategies can achieve any goal they set for themselves. NLP taught me how to set inspiring goals in my life and more importantly, how to build in myself the confidence and motivation to achieve them.

I learned that by modeling the mindset and strategies of anyone of excellence, I could produce the same outstanding results within a short period of time.

Empowered by the prospects of limitless self-growth, I applied everything I learned. 

Although I believed in the importance of excelling academically, I knew that scoring ‘A’s in school had very little to do with achieving success and creating wealth in life. 

One of the first books I read which influenced me tremendously was ‘Think and Grow Rich’ by Napoleon Hill. It was from Hill that I first understood the concept that money could be generated from ideas and not just hard work. I learned that if a person used his muscles, he would only be worth a few dollars a day. But if he were to use his mind, his wealth would be limitless.

### My Very First Business...Setting Up a Mobile Disco
That was when I first learned that great ideas make great money!

### My Second Business Idea...Adam Khoo & Associates
In fact, doing well academically helped me to create another source of income when I was in junior college doing my ‘A’ levels. 

However, after reading all these wealth books and learning the power of multiplying the effects of my efforts with ideas, I figured that I couldn’t make very much by tutoring one student at a time.

What really got me tons of business was when I decided to compile all my knowledge into a book. 

However, what truly enabled me to accumulate so much money was not so much the income I created, but the lessons I learned about saving and investing from the stacks of wealth books that I read. I develop the habit of saving far more than what I was earning, even when I was still studying.

Instead of spending my money indulging in fun and frivolous things, I invested almost everything I had into unit trusts and stocks through the investment strategies I had learned from reading books by wealth gurus like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and George Soros.

I knew when to sell not from a lucky tip-off, but through studying and understanding the market. 

At the age of 26, I had crossed the one million net worth mark.

All it took was intense desire, a mindset of infinite possibilities, the right strategies and consistent action and determination.

### Money is A Game...You Must Learn How to Play it
You see... making money is a game. If you learn the rules of this game, money will flow into your hands. If you do not play by the rules, you will struggle all your life financially despite working very hard.

Why? The **only** reason is because they know how to play the game of money whereas most people have not learned how the game is played.

You see... none of us are ever taught how to make money, how to invest money or how to manage our wealth and yet money is the most important subject in our adult lives. Although many people say that ‘**money isn’t everything**’, that’s only a half-truth. The truth is that ‘**everything is money**’! In order to achieve excellence in the different areas of lives like our health, relationships and family, we need to be financially secure!

To be financially secure means to be ‘Free’ .

The traditional education system (thank God it’s changing) never taught us how to be rich but instead brainwashed us into becoming poor. We are taught beliefs like ‘study hard, get good
grades and a good job and you’ll be set for life!’, ‘investing is risky’, ‘don’t act smart’, ‘don’t play with stocks or you’ll get burnt’, ‘don’t be so money-faced’ or ‘don’t be so stingy’.

As result of all the wrong anti-wealth advice, most people work hard all their lives, going around in circles in the rat race and ending up broke and unhappy. However, a fortunate few eventually learn that wealth is not made by just getting a good job and working hard. It takes a different way of thinking and a totally different strategy. Those that learn this lesson get out of the rat race and onto the path of financial abundance and freedom.

### First… You Must Know Why You Are Not Rich, Yet
> Reasons Why I Am Not Rich Yet
>
> 1. I'm too lazy		                                                           ✓
> 2. I'm lack of enough confidence                                  ✓
> 3. I was born in a poor family                                       ㄨ
> 4. I lack the financial know-how                                    ✓
> 5. I am afraid of taking risks                                          ✓
> 6. I lack discipline                                                             ✓
> 7. I have a suppressing family circumstance              ㄨ
> 8. I have no capital                                                          ㄨ

Why? Because the reasons you give yourself is a reflection of whether you have the
Winner’s mindset or the Victim’s mindset.

The reason all these are lousy excuses is because we know that there are many examples
of people who have created wealth for themselves, despite all these perceived disadvantages.

Victims also tend to blame everyone except themselves. 

And instead of finding a way to improve and change, victims spend their time complaining but not do anything about it.

The trouble is that when you give yourself excuses, blame others and whine, it means that someone else or something else is controlling your life and your (lack of) wealth. Since you believe that it is not your fault, then you are powerless to change it. If you have a victim’s mindset and hold doggedly onto the belief that external forces are controlling your wealth, then any strategy you learn will be of no use!

In order to fully benefit from the teachings in this book, you must first adopt the winner’s mindset. Winners take a hundred percent responsibility for the results in their life. They take ownership over their wealth. When their sales drop, they don’t blame their customers or the economy. They know that doing so will be futile since they can’t change these external factors. Instead, they take full responsibility for the fact that they did not sell hard enough, did not meet enough prospects or they used ineffective closing strategies. By taking responsibility for your results, you give yourself the power to change it! When winners don’t get a pay increase, they don’t blame their boss or their company, they take responsibility for the fact that they have not created enough value, not demonstrated their worth or have not asked for it!

The moment you acknowledge that you create your own fortune (or lack of it), it means that you have given yourself the power to start becoming rich right now! When you learn the strategies of wealth creation, you will find that you can make money at any age, with any background, with little or no money and in any economy. To find out how millionaires achieve this, you must first know ‘The Seven Steps to Financial Abundance’.

## 2 The Seven Steps to Financial Abundance
Although one millionaire may have made his money in real estate while another made her money providing children’s education, I would bet that all of them share similar wealth creating skills and took certain similar steps that allowed them to build up a large personal fortune. Of course there are individuals who seem to have oodles of money without having any of these wealth creating skills. They are usually people who inherited their money, won the lottery or have a marketable talent like singing. However, time and again it has been proven that if they do not eventually learn the necessary money skills, or have a trustworthy and money savvy manager, they will usually end up losing everything they have. 

These are seven essential steps, each one representing a wealth creating skill that all self-made millionaires possess and practice.

### Step 1: Adopt the Million-Dollar Mindset

Millionaires think very differently and that is why they take different actions and produce vastly different results. Self-made millionaires have a different set of beliefs and habits that allow them to see opportunities where others see problems.

Millionaires see learning experiences, where Mister Ordinary sees failure. The moment you adopt the beliefs and habits of a millionaire, your perception of the world will change completely
and you will realize that there are money-making opportunities everywhere and everyday around you.

*In chapter 3, you will learn the Nine Habits of Self-Made Millionaires and how to program your beliefs in such a way that your subconscious mind will begin to attract wealth to you.*

### Step 2: Set Clear Financial Goals

Wealth never happens by chance. It always begins with a clear goal in mind. At one point of time in their life, millionaires always make a decision to become rich. However, whenever I ask most people what their financial goals are, I often get a blank stare. When I ask people to write down their target income or how much they want to be worth, the standard answer I get is ‘as much as I can get’. This is a major reason why they will never achieve any level of wealth because they have no clue what it is. Unless you have a specific figure to focus on, you will never be able to develop a strategy to achieve it.

Only when you are specific abut how much wealth you want to create, then you will come up
with a practical plan to execute it. No matter where you are now financially, any target is possible as long as you use the right strategy.

In chapter 5, you will learn about the Four Levels of Wealth and how to achieve them. They are financial stability, financial security, financial freedom and financial abundance

### Step 3: Create A Financial Plan

Goals by themselves are nothing but pipe dreams. Only when you create a plan, have you
made your goal a possibility. The moment you start taking action on your plan, your dream becomes a reality.

Most people never achieve their financial dreams simply because they have no financial plans and haven’t got a clue as to how to create one. They just work hard and hope that everything will be okay one day. You cannot leave your financial future to chance, you have got to plan for it. While there are great financial planners around who can give you some sound advice, you must ultimately take responsibility and develop your own plan! After all, it is your life we are talking about.

*In chapters 4 and 5, you will learn how to craft a financial strategy and plan for yourself to reach the four levels of wealth.*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-11_16-17-10.png)

### Step 4: Massively Increase Your Income

After developing their financial plan, most people tend to become initially disheartened. They look at their plan and realize that with the amount they are earning and saving right now, it will be decades before they see any big money.

It is therefore important that you learn how to accelerate and turbo-charge your financial plan by taking steps to massively increasing your income. When I talk about increasing your income, I am not talking about a 5%, 10% or even 20% increase, I am talking about doubling, tripling or even increasing your income by five to ten times? Is this possible? Yes! And it is definitely achievable without you having to quit your job or risking a lot of capital (your savings) in a business venture.

*In chapters 6, 7 & 8, you will learn practical and proven methods that thousands of people use to create multiple streams of income for themselves. And in chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12, you will learn how you can start a lucrative home-based business and reach out to a global marketplace with the power of the Internet. You will learn how students, professionals, retirees and housewives have created a sustainable source of income for themselves.*

### Step 5: Manage Your Money & Reduce Expenses
The reason is because when we don’t manage the money we earn, our expenses will always rise to our level of income, wiping out any surplus we have! Or worse, we start spending on credit lured by easy repayment schemes. Millionaires become rich not because of how much they earn, but rather how much they are able to save and invest.

*In chapters 13 and 14, you will learn the essential money skills of how to track every dollar that flows through your hand and how you can amazingly reduce your expenses by 20%-30% without compromising your standard of living.*

### Step 6: Grow Your Money at Millionaire Returns
By increasing your income and reducing your expenses, you will find that you will be able to accumulate a surplus of funds that you can use to help you build your fortune. You need to do this because, no matter how hard you work and save, you will never be able to create phenomenal wealth unless you learn how to put your money to work for you. Through the power of compounding, you will be able to take small sums of money and build it into huge returns over time.

All self-made millionaires attribute a huge part of their wealth to their investments because they know that just working for money will never make them rich. It is when you allow your money to make you money that substantial wealth can be created.

If you’ve had the bad experience of losing money in stocks and mutual funds and resigned yourself to believing that the only safe way to invest is to put your money in the bank and get 3% returns, don’t worry. The strategies that I will be sharing carry minimal risk. Remember self-made millionaires are shrewd risk takers and this is very different from being gamblers.

*In chapters 15 to 19, you will learn never-before revealed investment techniques that can allow you to earn millionaire returns of 15%-25% per year with minimal risk. At this rate, your portfolio will be doubling in value every three to four years!*

### Step 7: Protect Your Fortune

There are many people who have taken decades to build their fortune only to see it wiped out by an accident, unforeseen illness or through an unexpected lawsuit. Self-made millionaires engage professionals like insurance advisors, lawyers and accountants to help them build a financial fortress so their wealth is protected from potential creditors, plaintiffs looking to sue and the government who may take away a big chunk of your wealth through a whole range of taxes that you may not have even heard about.

As it is beyond the scope of this book, I highly recommend that you engage such professionals who will help you use a variety of tools like insurance, trusts, offshore accounts to ensure no one or nothing can touch your wealth once you have built it.

## 3 The Nine Habits of Self-Made Millionaires
In this chapter, we are going to be exploring the million-dollar mindset, the first in the Seven Step Formula to Financial Abundance! Before learning the specific strategies and techniques of how to make and multiply your money, your mind must first be conditioned to wealth!

Remember, millionaires think and see the world very differently! Where most people see problems, those with the millionaire’s mindset see money-making opportunities. Where you see failure, the millionaire sees a valuable learning experience that will lead to greater opportunities and wealth.

Unless you have the millionaire’s mindset, you will never be able to see the limitless money-making opportunities around you. Without the millionaire’s mindset, you will not have the focus, drive and determination to take the massive action necessary to implement the ideas and strategies I am going to share with you.

Wealth must first be created in the mind before it can be manifested into physical reality. You must first be mentally wealthy before you can attract physical wealth. It has been proven time and again that people who have the millionaire’s mindset are able to attract and create fabulous wealth, even though they had started with absolutely nothing. Some even had all the odds stacked against them.

Such millionaire-minds, even if they suffer a major failure like bankruptcy or business failure and end up deep in debt, are able to bounce back and what’s more make back their losses plus more, within a short space of time.

Similarly, when you do not think like a millionaire, you will never attract wealth no matter how smart you are or how hard you work. I know many people who were academic achievers. Many of them work really hard in some great companies and are paid quite handsomely for their efforts. However, these professionals are not truly wealthy and, from the way I see it, they will never be financially free. And it has got nothing to do with their job, it’s got to do with their mindset.

### So What is The Million-Dollar Mindset?

MINDSET ➝ THOUGHTS ➝ ACTIONS ➝ RESULTS

The amazing thing about Branson was that he did not use any of his money to solve his ‘problem’. He used his millionaire mindset and thinking to turn a problem into an opportunity, which not only solved his problem, but made him even more money.

So, if you are not creating tremendous wealth right now, it is because you are not taking the right actions. In other words, if you want to massively change the results in your life, you have to take different actions. To take different actions, you have to think differently. And of course to think differently, you must have a different mindset... the million-dollar mindset.

The million-dollar mindset is made up of your habits, beliefs, values and attitudes.

Now let’s get onto learning the ‘Nine Habits of Self-Made millionaires’. Follow them strictly and money will fl ow into your hands, break them and money will forever elude you.

### Millionaire Habit 1: Always Exceed Expectations
Unless you know WHY you want to be rich, you will never have the passion to go for it. Take as much time as you need to list down the reasons.

> 1. I want to get independent from my family.
> 2. I want to have my own apartment in China.
> 3. I want to have sex with beautiful girls and women.
> 4. I want to get physically strong.
> 5. I want my father to kneel to me.
> 6. I want to immigrate to Canada or USA.
> 7. I want to travel around the world.
> 8. I want to get a house in Canada or USA.
> 9. I want to taste global delicious food.
> 10. I want to be a popular guy in some communities on the internet
> 11. I want to learn mathematics in USA.

You will need these reasons to carry on benefiting from this book. It is EXTREMELY important.

#### The Value Reducers

I have discovered that people fall into three categories. In the first category are those who have the habit of **doing less than what is expected.** Their patterns are reflected in the fact that they probably write down three or four reasons.

Because of this pattern of thinking and action, these people do not add any kind of value to their company or department. In fact, they tend to reduce the value their company creates. These are the people who, when asked to do ABCD, will end up doing just A and B, forgetting or screwing up C & D.

Obviously, if you operate from this pattern you will never achieve success and wealth!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-11_16-06-07.png)

Then there are people who fall into the second category, those who have the habit of doing **exactly as expected**. This group will obediently write down five reasons as the instructions were ‘write **at least** five reasons’. 

The majority of people in life think and act this way, and that is why they are not rich and wealthy. 

People who do exactly as they are expected sustain the value of their department or company.

Well, they are what I call a low return investment.  Since they are responsible people who get the job done, they will be given more responsibilities as the company expands. As their job scope increases, so does their position and pay.

However, this group will only be promoted up to a certain point. They will eventually hit a ceiling. This ceiling is normally that of a manager. Why? Because they can only take orders and get things done. They lack the attitude to do more! Although they are considered assets, people in this category are dispensable assets. In other words, they are easily replaceable. Because of this, many would get retrenched the moment they reach a certain age. When the company finds that they can hire someone else at half their age and at half their pay to do the same job, they will get displaced. As you know, many middle managers suffer this fate when they reach their mid forties. Again, if you choose to be in this second category, you will never have financial security and freedom.

#### The Value Creators

Did you write down more than five reasons? If you did, then you belong to the minority of individuals in the third category, the value creators. Value creators end up as the rich and wealthy of our society. It is not something you are born with, it has got nothing to do with your academic qualifications but it is a habit of choice that anyone can adopt. Value creators have the habit of doing a lot more than expected. / It is through their efforts, that the company makes more and more profits every year. As a result, their income is not considered an expense to the company, but a great investment.

Even in periods of downturns, when everyone else is getting retrenched and pay cuts, they get pay increases, bonuses and stock options. The company knows that for every dollar they invest in them, they will return triple the value. These people are the high flyers who get promoted super fast and get their incomes doubling and tripling in a few years.

In the past, income was based mainly on seniority and loyalty. The longer you stayed, the more you were valued. In today’s world, income is based entirely on the amount of value you can create. It is not uncommon to see people who are much younger, with a lot less experience directing businesses and earning lots more than senior workers who have been with the company a lot longer.

Value creators are indispensable assets to their company! / So, the first unbreakable habit of
wealth is to do a lot more than expected. In chapter 6, you will learn specifically about how to create massive value that will lead to massive income!

This habit does not just apply to employees, it applies to anyone from sports stars to business owners. *When Michael Jordan was interviewed and asked how he became the world’s greatest basketball player,*
*he replied, “I expect more from myself than anyone would ever expect from times a week, I would train me!” When my coach expects me to train three five times. When my coach expects me to score 15 points for each game, I would score 36 points! That is why I am the best in the world”.*

#### Do Exactly As Expected, And You Will Soon Be Out of Business
As an entrepreneur today, you must do a lot more than expected in order to run a successful business and create wealth! In the past, economies were a lot less competitive. In the past, when a business
performed below customer’s expectations, they would be struggling to break even. If a business met their customer’s expectations, they would make good profits. If a business exceeded their customer’s expectations, they would become a market leader and would earn huge profits!

Why do over 90% of businesses fail today? It’s because markets have become so much more competitive. If you start a retail store, you are competing with hundreds of others, both locally and
internationally! Today, if you perform below customer’s expectations, customers will never come back and you will go bust! Today, if you meet customer expectations, you will still be struggling to survive! Why?

This is because hundreds of other businesses can also meet your client’s expectations, and some of them do so at half your cost. You will find that you will be competing on price most of the time and will earn so little that it is hardly worth your while. / In today’s marketplace, if you exceed your client’s expectations,
you will only earn nominal profits because many businesses already do their best to add more value to their clients.

So how do you make huge profits and become a millionaire in business today? The answer is that you have to go way beyond your client’s expectations. You have to give them an unbelievable experience where they will keep coming back to your business and tell all their friends about you. You must set your standards so high that they will never go to anyone else for that particular product or service. When you highly exceed your client’s expectations, you can charge a premium and make huge profits. This has been my secret of success for all my businesses and I want you to learn this same secret right now!

> **My Competitors**
>
> - Present a one-hour preview detailing what is taught in their programs.
> - Offer a five-day program focusing primarily on study skills & basic motivation.
> - Provide ad-hoc follow up and customer service.
>

>

> - Students get unlimited free re-attendance to the program.
> - Students get a series of encouragement emails for three months that keeps them focused.

As you can see, by giving my customers an unrivaled experience and offering tremendous value, my programs are clearly the best value, even at higher prices! So once again, the first unbreakable wealth habit is to always do a lot more than expected! Exceed expectations and your wealth will multiply massively.

### Millionaire Habit 2: Be Proactive

I notice that there will always be some people who will go around introducing themselves first and getting to know as many people as they can. These people exhibit the pattern of being proactive. People who are proactive are people who take the initiative to **make things happen**. When there are no opportunities, proactive people are those that go out and find opportunities. If they cannot find any, they will create their own opportunities. When problems get in their way, proactive people will take action to solve their own problems!

On the other hand, there would always be an even larger number of people who will just stand around and wait for others to come and shake their hand. These people exhibit the **reactive** mindset. People with the reactive mindset have the habit of **waiting for things to happen to them**. They tend to act only in reaction to others’ actions. As a result, they have a lot less control and choices over results that affect them. When no opportunities present themselves, reactive people just sit and wait for the opportunities to come to them. They are characteristic of people who complain about everything that is happening around them and hope that something will change. When reactive people face problems, they will just wait for others to come and solve their problem.

Remember the example I gave you earlier about Richard Branson who took the unthinkable action to charter a plane and sell seats on it when he was stranded? That is a clear example of proactive thinking. Again, most people will just be reactive and wait for someone to come and fix their problems.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-11_16-51-29.png)

By having the proactive mindset, you put yourself in the position of power and choice. You are in command and will take action that leads to wealth and success. However, when you act in a reactive
pattern, you will find that your finances will never be within your control.

### Millionaire Habit 3: Take 100% Responsibility

Wealth habit number three is the habit of taking responsibility for your results and wealth! Unfortunately most people choose to adopt the victim’s mindset of giving excuses, blaming and
complaining. Remember when you give excuses to yourself (i.e. no time, no luck, no capital, no experience, etc...) or blame others for your lack of wealth, then you are putting others and external events in control of your life! When you are not in control, you do not have the power to change your circumstances.

Instead, millionaires take 100% responsibility for their wealth. They believe that they alone create their wealth through their strategies and actions. As a result, they know that they have the power to change their wealth by changing their strategies and actions. It is only when you live by this habit will you have the
power to exponentially multiply your income and wealth.

### Millionaire Habit 4: Delayed Gratification

What keeps most people from becoming rich is the habit of wanting instant gratification. Instant gratification is the habit of always wanting to enjoy now and not having the patience to wait for future benefits. As a result, these people spend a lot more than they invest. By spending on that new car, new widescreen television set or designer watch they get instant gratification. When it comes to investing in books, seminars, stocks or insurance products, they will think twice as they have to wait for future benefits. It is precisely for this reason that whatever money comes into their hands will soon be frittered away and not multiplied.

People who want instant gratification will always look for quick and easy ways of making money rather than building a sustainable business that adds value to (repeat) customers. They tend to cut corners on quality and deliver shoddy products to save money and boost short term profits. As a result, their profits rarely last and they will soon go out of business.

At the same time, those who desire instant gratification lack the patience to allow their money to grow and compound through investing. When they don’t see huge sums of money in a few weeks, they abandon their investments and never get to reap the benefits. They have no patience to wait for the seeds they sow to grow into huge money trees that bear fruit.

You see, there are only two ways you can use your money. You can either spend it or invest it. When you spend $100, you get gratified from whatever you bought but that $100 is gone! You get zero returns. When you invest that $100 in a seminar, books or stock, it will grow into $120, $200, $500 or even $1000, depending on your rate of return.

On the other hand, all millionaires adopt the habit of ‘delayed gratification’. They have the patience to wait for greater abundance in the future. Whether in business or in investments, you must have delayed gratification in order to create massive wealth.

People with delayed gratification invest a lot more than they spend. Again, they know that by spending a dollar, they may feel good for an instant, but their future wealth will be destroyed. When it comes to spending money, they are extremely frugal. However when it comes to investing, they do not think twice about writing a check for a few thousands dollars. They know that through patience, that money will multiply into a future fortune.

Millionaires never take shortcuts in business. They look at always giving the best value to their customers, even if it means earning less at present. They know that by building their reputation, it will lead
to huge profit streams in the future.

I cannot emphasize this value enough because I feel that it is what has really set me apart from all my peers. It is why I earn many more times than most people my age. You see, when I was in college and university, most of my friends spent their holidays partying and having fun. They experienced instant gratification.

Instead of partying, I would spend all my holidays taking up speaking engagements to hone my presentation skills, reading investment books, analyzing company reports and writing chapters of my first book. I knew that by ‘sacrificing’ my immediate enjoyment, the rewards in the future would be tremendous! Sure enough by the time I graduated from University I had streams of passive income from my best-selling book and two businesses that I had set up. I was earning more money than many of my lecturers while many of my friends were struggling to get their first job with their first paycheck.

Frankly, I never felt deprived. I had so much passion for what I was doing that indulging in drinking and idle lounge-lizard chatter just seemed like a huge waste of time. Nor did I miss social companionship. I had a steady, supportive girlfriend (now my wife), and a core of close buddies in these businesses we ran (and had so much fun and profit), while still studying. In fact a couple of them are still working with me today.

Let me give you another example. When it comes to spending money, I am extremely hesitant. Once I saw a mobile phone that I really liked. It was priced at $800. I kept staring at that phone over and over again but eventually walked away. I found it just too painful to part with $800 for a phone. My friends thought I was crazy as I was earning over $1,000 an hour at the time, whenever I spoke. But then again, I knew that the moment I spent that $800, it would be gone!

On the other hand, whenever I go to a bookstore, I think nothing of spending $800 buying a whole series of marketing, business and investment books. In fact, I once spent $12,000 attending an NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) training course in the United States, without even thinking twice. Why? Because I know that if I spend that $12,000, the ideas that I get from those books and seminars, when applied, will generate me millions and so they have! But most people do the exact opposite. They think nothing of squandering $3,000 on a ring but think twice before buying a good book for $30! No wonder they are poor! So, develop the habit of delayed gratification – and spend wisely – and you will see your money multiply.

### Millionaire Habit 5: Do What You Love

The most common question that people ask me about getting rich is, ‘what is the best career or business that will make me the most money?’ Should I go into education? Food? Insurance? Network
marketing? Health Care? Options trading? Property? What’s the best industry to be in right now?

Well, you will find that in ANY industry, there will be a minority who will be making plenty of money, while the majority will be struggling to survive. / So my answer to that question is that you can become a millionaire in ANY INDUSTRY, only if you are one of the best! If you are not one of the best, you will never become rich in ANY industry.

So, how do you become the best in the market? The answer is by being totally, absolutely one hundred percent committed towards your particular career or business. People become the best at what they do only because they eat, sleep, breathe, talk and think their business eighteen hours a day (sometimes, they even dream about it as they sleep). In other words, they are obsessed with doing what they do and are constantly finding ways to do it better. And the only way you can become totally obsessed and committed towards something is when you have a love and passion for it!

All successful individuals have one thing in common. They love what they do. And because they have such an intense passion for their particular career or business, they do not distinguish work from play. Their work is their play and vice versa. As a result, they spend every single day and every waking hour working (to them it’s not work), and that is why they become so good at it that they become market leaders and experts. 

While people are out there partying and celebrating the start of the New Year, I am in my office getting this book finished so it can be published in early 2006. All my friends think I am nuts for being a workaholic who works 19-hours a day and 364 days a year. / What people don’t realize is that to me, this is not work, it’s fun! It is because of my obsession and total focus on what I do that has allowed me to overtake all my competitors to become the best in my industry.

Every successful millionaire I know has a love and obsession for what they do. 

Similarly, Tiger Woods is the best golfer in the world because he is obsessed with golf. It is his intense passion for the game that gets him to hit hundreds of balls under the hot sun every single day till he gets it perfect! It is his passion that gets him to continue competing in tournaments despite already having amassed a personal fortune of US $575 million. It is not the money that motivates him. It has always been the love for the game and the love of competing. Have you ever wondered why Bill Gates, the richest man in the world who is worth US$46 billion still works 18-hour days, every single day? Why doesn’t he just sit back and relax on the beach? The reason is because like all millionaires, what drives him is never really the money per se; it is the love of being at the forefront of technology. It was his obsession of ‘putting a computer in every home running Microsoft software’ that made him the best in the field. / If you read all their biographies, you will find that none of them got into their industries because they thought it was lucrative. They got in because it was what they loved to do. They love to do it so much that they would even do it for free. This is why although they never have to work for money ever again, they keep working harder and harder. It is because it was never work in the first place.

> Unless you do what you love to do, you will never become rich – Adam Khoo

Many people have the belief that millionaires are people who are just naturally more motivated, disciplined and focused. The truth is that when anyone does something he or she loves, the motivation,
focus and discipline always comes naturally. If you find that you lack the motivation and discipline to become successful in what you do, the reason is very obvious. It is not your passion! Think about it. Do you have a natural passion for something? Do you have a hobby? Like playing golf? Looking at beautiful women or men? Computer games? Football? Playing with children? Haven’t you noticed that whenever you are doing what you love, the energy never stops? It’s like no matter how tired you are, you will always find the energy to do what you love. Well, this is the secret that will lead to your success and wealth! You have to find something you are extremely passionate about and build your career or business around it! When you do, you will find that you will be naturally focused, committed and energized to work at it. When you give your best to whatever you are crazy about, you will become the best!

You see, many people have the mindset that they have to work very hard in life in order to become rich. They have got to force themselves to be disciplined and motivated. They believe that when they eventually make enough money, they can finally do what they love to do and enjoy their lives.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-11_17-35-04.png)

This is a recipe that is guaranteed to make you struggle in stress and misery all your life. When you do something purely for the money and not because of passion, you will find it very difficult to stay motivated. After a while, you will burn out and give up from the stress and exhaustion.

Instead, you must do what you love to do now! Not only will you begin to enjoy your life and be happy but you will suddenly find the natural energy and motivation that will drive you to give your best and become the best. When this happens, the money will automatically follow.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-11_17-38-39.png)

Whenever I teach this in my seminars, people will always have two more questions for me. The first question is, ‘How do I know if I am truly passionate about something?’ To find the answer, just ask yourself this question, ‘If I had all the money in the world, would I still be in this career/business?’ If the answer is ‘yes’, then it is truly your passion. If the answer is ‘no’, then you are definitely in the wrong industry. In fact, when I had the opportunity to interview the top insurance advisors in Singapore (I specialize in insurance
sales training), I found that those who were highly successful, earning over $500,000 a year, had one thing in common. They were not primarily motivated by the money but by the love of helping people.

The second question that people always ask me is, ‘just because I love something, can I always make money from it’? ‘What if my passion has no market value’? The answer is ‘yes’! You can always make a highly lucrative career out of any passion! You only need to learn how to make it marketable and learn how to commercialize it! This is exactly what you will learn to do in the chapters that follow! More specifically, you will learn how to turn your ideas and passion into endless streams of income in chapters 8 and 9!

Whether you have a passion for computer games, gorgeous women/men, knitting, cooking, surfing, trading, people, children, fish or even iguanas.

**So start asking yourself...**

- ‘What do I love to do?’ ‘What would I do even if I didn’t get paid?’
- ‘If I had all the money in the world, how would I spend my time?’
- ‘Who are people who have made their fortunes around this passion I have?’

I guarantee you that when you start looking for them, you will find no lack of role models you can learn from. Remember, do what you love and you will never work another day in your life!

### Millionaire Habit 6: Acting with Integrity

Many people have the perception that the fabulously rich and powerful are dishonest and unethical. And who can blame them after hearing stories of how millionaire executives rip off their shareholders in scandal after scandal on Wall Street?

Certainly there are unethical & unscrupulous rich people around (incidentally, their wealth & businesses rarely last), but the truth is that most self-made millionaires share a common habit of personal integrity. Interestingly, in the best-selling book ‘The Millionaire Mind’, author Thomas Stanley interviewed 733 multi-millionaires and asked them what were the key factors that contributed to their wealth. Ranked number one was ‘being honest with people’. Surprised? This factor was ranked way ahead of factors like ‘making wise investments’, ‘working hard’ and ‘having a competitive spirit’. What is integrity and why is it so important to long term wealth?

Integrity is about being honest with others and adhering to high moral standards. It is also about doing what you say you will do. When you act with integrity, your customers, colleagues and staff will place their trust in you. They know that you mean what you say and that you will not let them down. They know that you will give them the best quality for their money and they know that you will not cheat them.

> It takes twenty years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently – Warren E. Buffett, world’s second richest man

In a world where so many people are unethical and dishonest, build your reputation on integrity and you will have an endless supply of customers, suppliers, investors and business partners. / In order
to keep the business going, he persuaded his customers to pay him in advance so that he could use the money to buy the products from his suppliers. The only reason his customers agreed was because Goel had built up his reputation as an honest and trustworthy man while dealing with them in the past.

Over the years, I have had many people who have approached me to do business with them and I have turned most of them down, no matter how great the opportunities to make money seemed to be. As a result, many people have asked me what I look for in a business partner (they know that anyone who works with me will make a lot of money). My answer is that ‘integrity’ is above everything else. So, always act with integrity and you will possess one of the greatest strengths of all.

### Millionaire Habit 7: Be 100% Committed

Let me ask you this question, ‘Do you **want** to be rich?’, ‘Of course, that’s why I’m reading this book!’, you may say. Let me ask you the next question, ‘Are you **100% committed** to be rich?’.

You see, there is a very big difference between **wanting** to become a millionaire and being **100% committed** to becoming a millionaire. When you merely want, wish or hope to achieve a goal, it will rarely ever happen. Think about it. Everybody wants to be financially free, but very few ever make it happen.

Studies after studies have shown that people who achieve phenomenal success and wealth did not just want it, they were 100% committed to achieving it. When you are 100% committed to a goal, it is no longer a wish, a hope or a want... it becomes an absolute MUST. You see, when something becomes an absolute MUST to you, it gets you to operate from a totally different frame of mind. When something is a MUST, it will become your number one priority and nothing will ever come in its way until that goal is accomplished. When something is a MUST, you will do **whatever it takes** to get it (within limits of integrity of course)! Even if it means stretching way beyond your comfort zone and investing time, energy or money, you will do whatever it takes.

I believe that when you are willing to do whatever it takes to get something, you will ALWAYS find a way. And if you cannot find a way, you will make a way.

However, when you merely have a weak ‘wish’ or ‘hope’ for wealth, you will never attain it. Why? This is because the path to achieving any goal and creating wealth is never easy. It fact, it is extremely challenging and difficult. I can bet you that when you begin on your path to financial freedom, there are going to be
huge obstacles and challenges that will get in your way. All the problems that you can possibly think of will come to test your faith and endurance and to stretch you out of your comfort zone. You will find that at certain points of time, you will lack the time, lack the money and lack the energy. You may encounter people discouraging you, friends leaving you and things not going as planned (trust me, I have experienced all this and more).

If it is merely a ‘wish’ that you have to become rich, chances are that you will eventually give up and find lots of excuses of why it cannot be done. This is because those that merely ‘wish’ for success are never willing to stretch beyond their comfort zones and do what ever it takes to overcome all their challenges. In addition, when something is merely a ‘want’, you will find that your mind will be filled by a dozen other ‘wants’ that will take away your time and attention. After a while, you will find yourself being distracted by
other things that come your way. Has this happened to you before?

So, the only way you will ever achieve your goals of becoming rich is to make it a MUST for yourself. I remember that when I was in Secondary school, a group of close friends and I shared our dreams about becoming millionaires and business owners. The only difference was that for many of them, that dream was merely a dream. For me, it was an absolute must! I was so totally obsessed with the idea that during those school lunch breaks I would be designing my company name cards with the title ‘Adam Khoo – CEO’.

Sure enough when I approached my friends with the opportunity to set up the disco business venture (earlier mentioned in chapter one), many of them started giving excuses like ‘we are too busy’, ‘our parents will object’, ‘what if it doesn’t work’, ‘what if we lose money’, ‘we have something on over the weekends’ and so on. Because their goals were not an absolute must to them, they naturally let all the perceived obstacles and excuses get in their way. Because it was a must for me to make money, I knew that I would find a way
to make it happen... and I did.

Let me give you another example. Have you ever had a list of goals to achieve or actions to take, but kept putting them off? I’m sure you have, as it is pretty common to procrastinate. Did you eventually get
some of them done? Why? Why is it that you eventually got some things done but not the rest? I would bet that those things that you got done eventually became a must for you! It eventually crossed the deadline and you HAD to get it done. As for the rest, we will usually continue putting it off until it becomes an ‘absolute must’ one day.

You see, we will never do anything in our life until it becomes an absolute must for us. The trouble is that when something becomes a must, it is often too late. For example, I know a friend who set a goal to quit smoking. He knew that it was doing him harm and he really wanted to. Sure enough, he kept procrastinating year after year. Suddenly, in 2003, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and told that if he didn’t stop, he would die in six months. He hasn’t touched a cigarette since. You see, when something is a ‘must’, anything can be achieved. At the same time, when you make financial freedom and security a must for you and not just a wish, you will achieve it. When something is a must, our brain gets us to tap our fullest potential to make it happen.

The trouble is that becoming financially abundant is rarely a must for most people. It is merely a wish. However, it is always a must to survive... and that it why most people merely survive. So once again, to achieve all your financial goals, you have to make it a must for yourself. How do you make something a ‘must’? The answer is by putting yourself on the line. When you put yourself in situation where you give yourself no choice BUT to succeed, you very often will.

If you study the life stories of millionaire history makers, many of them came to a point in their lives where they put themselves on the line and staked everything they had. And because they had NO CHOICE but to succeed, they often did it against insurmountable odds.

When Vikas Goel needed to get the funds to start his company eSys Technologies, he walked into the Bank of India to get a bank loan. In order to persuade them that he was sincere and confident, he pledged his entire future family inheritance from India. It was this level of commitment that made it possible for him to overcome all the odds that stood in his way.

**Star Wars**

As a teenager, Lucas set a goal of becoming a millionaire at the age of thirty. He was off by two
years: Lucas made his millions by the age of twenty-eight.

However, you don’t necessarily have to risk all your money like Vikas Goel or George Lucas to get totally committed to your goal. There are other ways of putting yourself on the line. As for me, I personally put myself on the line by making public commitments. Whenever I set a goal, I would announce to everyone my plans because I know that the moment I do so, there would be no turning back. I had to make it happen! So before moving on to the next millionaire habit, I want you to make a decision to be 100% committed to your wealth. Do whatever it takes to finish this book and apply what you learn, and I will guarantee that your wealth will multiply many-fold.

### Millionaire Habit 8: The Ability to Turn Failure into Success
The final millionaire habit is the ability to accept failure and to turn it into success. Most people have the impression that successful people never fail and that millionaires never lose money. As a result, many people fear failure and shun those who have flopped. This is a huge lie and distortion that prevents people from becoming rich.

The truth is that everybody fails at one point or another. In fact, millionaires fail more times than anybody else because they take so much more action. I have made countless stupid mistakes, lost a lot of money and have failed so often that I have lost count. So mark my words, you will fail many times before you ever succeed. What’s important is what you do about failure. This is the critical habit that makes the difference between the rich and the poor.

There are three ways people respond to failure. The first group of people get so disappointed by their failure that they just give up! They would say, ‘I tried it but I failed’ or ‘I tried investing but it didn’t work for me’. They see failure as the end of the game, as the final verdict that they are not meant to succeed. They give themselves reasons like ‘Maybe I am not good enough’ or ‘it’s just too difficult’. Have you ever been guilty of doing this before? Sure enough, this way of responding to failure will see many dreams fade away.

The second group does not give up that easily. When they don’t reach their outcome, they would say, ‘Let me try again. Let’s not give up’. So they quickly get on their feet and try again. If their business fails, they go start another business. If they lose money investing in the stock market, they will go and try to buy different stocks. Will they eventually succeed? The answer is ‘No’. Why? It is because this group may try and try again but they don’t change their strategy. They keep making the same mistakes, doing the same thing again and again. Sure enough they keep getting the same disappointing results. So what happens after a while? They eventually get so frustrated and tired that they too will throw in the towel. Some may even begin to accept mediocrity and fear to dream of anything better. Do you know anyone who has been
caught in this trap? Have you ever done it yourself?

> Success is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is the result of experience. Experience is the result of bad judgment – Anthony Robbins

Millionaires approach and perceive failure very differently. When they don’t reach their goals, millionaires do not see themselves as having failed. Rather, they see themselves as getting a learning
experience! To them, failure is not the end, but only a detour. They see it as feedback that they are not using the right strategy. They then take this feedback, learn from the experience and change their strategy! If changing their strategy still does not get them the result, they will once again get more feedback, change their strategy and take action again. They keep doing this again and again until they get the results they want! They will do whatever it takes UNTIL they succeed. By doing so, they turn their failures into success!

> My policy is to learn from the past, focus on the present, and dream about the future. I’m a firm believer in learning from adversity. Often the worst of times can turn to your advantage, my life is a study of that – Donald Trump, after turning around his $935 million debt into a $3.7 billion fortune

Very seldom do millionaires achieve their success on the first go. Many achieve their financial dreams only after countless learning experiences and setbacks. However, many agree that if not for those ‘learning experiences’, they would never have found the solutions to their outcomes. / And that one idea turned Creative Technologies into a billion dollar global company. You see, all you need is only ONE great idea that will make you your fortune. However, that ONE great idea hardly ever comes the first time around. It only comes after lots of bad ideas.

Another great example that never fails to inspire me about turning crushing failure into resounding success is the story of Steve Jobs, the founder and current CEO of Apple Computers. Steve co-founded Apple at the age of 21 in 1976. Within four years, the company was listed on the stock exchange and Steve was worth US$217 million at the age of 25.

As Apple continued its phenomenal growth, it was decided that professional management had to be hired to run the huge organization. So in 1983, Steve hired John Scully to be the CEO. However, within two years, the CEO and directors at Apple could not get along with Steve Jobs (he was known to be an erratic and emotional manager) and stripped him of all his duties, forcing him to resign from the very company he founded in failure and disgrace. To make things worse, Apple sued Steve for neglecting his duties.

While those in the business world wrote him off, Steve who possessed the millionaire mindset, took it as a huge learning experience (millionaire habit 8) and took the proactive action (millionaire habit 2) of starting a new and better company called NeXT computers. He believed that he could develop a range of
hardware and software that would be even better than that at Apple. Did he succeed? Unfortunately, NeXT’s hardware division became a huge failure. Undaunted, he again took the feedback and went on to found Pixar Animation Studios, which became a huge success in creating the first breakthrough fully digitally animated movie ‘Toy Story’.

In the meantime, Apple Computer was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1995 after suffering from internal mismanagement and lack of new product innovation. The company was making losses of $800 million to $1 billion a year and its share price dropped from a high of $18 to $3.80. Believing that he could save Apple, Steve Jobs agreed to return as CEO for a nominal pay of $1 (he was doing it purely for the passion... millionaire habit 5). When Steve took over, he fired all the unproductive executives and spearheaded the
launch of revolutionary products like the iMac, iPod and iTunes. The revolutionary operating system (OS) he developed at NeXT was then evolved into the highly popular Mac OS X. As a result of these successful products, Apple turned its $1 billion loss into $1.3 billion in profits by 2005. Its share price rose from $3.80 to a high of $75! Looking back, Steve realized that if he never got fired from Apple, he would never have founded NeXT and Pixar Animation. If not for Pixar, he would not have become a pioneer in digital animation and if not for NeXT software he developed, Apple would never have the Mac OS X operating system that has made Apple a huge success today. It is for this reason that many millionaires believe
that ‘everything happens for a reason’ and that ‘adversity is often opportunity in disguise’ provided you learn from your experiences and continue to take consistent action!

### Millionaire Habit 9: Respect & Love Money

The fi nal and one of the most important wealth habits is to respect and love money. I don’t mean loving money to the extent that you are a slave to it, but loving money for the good it can do for you and
the people around you.

Most people I share this with often respond by saying, ‘Well, of course I love money! Of course I respect money.’ Who doesn’t? If I didn’t love money for what it can do, I wouldn’t be reading this book.

Well there are many people who consciously desire to be rich and know that money is important. However, at a deeper level they may not realize that their subconscious mind either holds many limiting beliefs about money or associate lots of negative feelings towards money. These negative associations cause them to repel money and prevent them from becoming rich without even realizing it.

Do you feel that although you consciously desire to be rich, but something holds you back? Have you experienced working hard to achieve your goals. However the moment you start getting results and seeing your wealth increase, you tend to go into the pattern of sabotaging it? Like the moment your bank account hits a certain amount, you start losing your motivation until the money dips below a certain level then you start working hard again? It’s like your subconscious mind is preventing you from going beyond a certain level of wealth. I know of some friends who say that the moment they get a certain amount of money, they will tend to spend it away or lose it. If you are experiencing the same phenomenon, it is because subconsciously, your mind doesn’t want you to be rich. Again, its either because you have a lot of negative associations towards money or many limiting beliefs are holding you back.

I remember a time when I gave a seminar to a group of teenagers and I was teaching them about the power of spotting opportunities and taking action on them. I took out a $10 bill and said that I was selling it for $2. I waved the bill in my hand for a good 10 minutes asking if there were any takers, but none came up. Eventually, one boy hesitantly came up and took the money. ‘Buying this $10 note for $2 represents a great profit opportunity, so why didn’t any of you come up?’ I asked. The answers I got were: ‘I didn’t want people to think I was money-faced’, ‘I did not want to cheat you of your money’, ‘I thought it must be a trick’. In other words, what prevented them from taking action on any opportunity were the limiting beliefs and associations they had formed about money. The scary thing is that the same thing happens in life! Why is it
that some people see and act on money making opportunities everyday while others just don’t see them? Again, it is because of the beliefs that have been formed in their subconscious mind.

As many of us grow up, we may unknowingly pick up many limiting beliefs and painful associations towards money from our family members, friends, teachers and relatives. Many people are taught that if they think about money or desire money, then they are being ‘money faced’ or ‘money minded’. As a result, their subconscious starts associating thoughts and desire for money as being bad or evil. This explains why those teens did not dare show that they are a ‘money minded’ person by taking advantage of the opportunity. Have you been taught to believe this as well? Because many people who come from working class families see their parents working so hard for money, they subconsciously believe that working hard is the only way to make money. This belief causes them to fail to realize that big money is from ideas and not just hard work. When they see $10 being offered for $2 they think that it must be some sort of trick or that they will be cheating me. What they don’t realize is that there are opportunities like this everyday! Warren
Buffett made his billions by buying companies at half of what they were really worth. He was buying $10 stocks for $2 (you will learn exactly how to do this in chapters 18 and 19). Entrepreneurs make money by buying something a lot cheaper than what it is worth, re-packaging it and sell it for ten times the price!

If you come from a poor or middle class family, there is a good chance that you may have been taught that ‘money isn’t everything’, ‘money doesn’t grow on trees’, ‘rich people are greedy’, ‘money is not important’, ‘if you have a lot of money then people will cheat you’, ‘investing is risky’, ‘money will change you’. As a result, your subconscious mind associates so much fear, hate and negative feelings towards money that it will stop you from ever becoming rich. You may feel this inner power struggle inside you such that although you set your goals to become rich, but somehow, you sabotage your own success every time you achieve a certain level of wealth. Your inner mind won’t allow you to become rich as it would give you more ‘problems’ or make you into a ‘bad person’. However, you have to understand that your friends, parents or teachers may have taught you all these things because they probably thought they were passing on good advice. Their parents and teachers probably taught it to them as well, and that is why they have never become rich. Very often, they also choose to believe all these negative things about money because it helps them to justify their own lack of money. When someone says, ‘well... money isn’t all that important
anyway’, they are just consoling themselves. When someone says, ‘I love my family and that’s why I have no time to make money’, they are just giving themselves justifications.

So, it is really important for you to stop for a while and really reflect about the inner feelings you have towards money. I know that consciously you respect and love money for what it can do, but I want you to set aside your pre-judgments and really think about the subconscious beliefs and feelings that you associate with money. I once had a participant, Joshua who couldn’t understand why despite working hard, having a strong education and learning the strategies of wealth creation, just couldn’t seem to hold on to
his money for long. Every time he closes a few big deals (he was a property agent) and made a nice pile of cash, he would sabotage his success by spending it all away. He just couldn’t understand why. When I got him to relax and think back into the past, he was shocked to find the answer. Apparently when he was a young child, he saw his neighbor’s family constantly fighting and arguing. The adults were perpetually miserable and constantly neglected their only child. When Joshua asked his parents why the neighbors had so much problems, he remembered his parents reply, ‘these rich people have got more problems... they always argue about money’. Because of that belief that ‘money gives you problems’ and the painful feelings
he associated with wealth, Joshua kept repelling wealth without him realizing it. The moment he started identifying the problem and resolving it, his ability to hold onto and multiply his money began to change dramatically.

So, I want you to grab a pen and spend a full, uninterrupted ten minutes to do this exercise. The moment you start, I want you to write down as many answers to the following statements: ‘Money
is... ’, ‘Having money will... ’ and ‘rich people are... ’. I want you to write down at least forty (that’s right... forty!) associations. It is important that you don’t stop to ponder or think about what you are writing. Just write whatever comes into your mind. If you think too much or too long about it, you are going to come up
with a lot of useless politically correct answers. What you should be interested in are your hidden subconscious associations! The only way to get them out is to keep pushing yourself to write non-stop. Even when you feel like you are stuck and there is nothing left to write, squeeze something out, be it positive or negative. I bet you will be surprised with what you come up with. So are you ready? Stop reading now and start writing! (Remember, don’t stop until you hit at least 40 associations).

Give yourself a pat on the back for completing the exercise. I know it wasn’t easy. So, what have you uncovered from penning down all your thoughts?

What beliefs or associations do you have about money? Are they positive or negative? Good or bad? What beliefs do you have about rich people? Do you respect them or resent them? Do you admire them or loathe them? If you resent rich people and think that they are bad, then your unconscious mind will NEVER allow you to become rich. Why? This is because if you become rich, then you will become a ‘bad person’.

#### Common Negative Beliefs & Associations About Money
After conducting this exercise with thousands of people in different countries, I have found the following common negative associations consistently being revealed. Do you share any of them?

> - Money is the ‘root of all evil’
> - Money will make you materialistic
> - Money will make you less spiritual
> - If I became wealthy, I will lose all my friends
> - Money doesn’t grow on trees
> - Rich people are greedy and selfish
> - Rich people are stingy
> - To get rich, you must be lucky, dishonest or really smart
> - Money will not buy you happiness
> - Money isn’t that important anyway
> - To have more money, I will be depriving others of it
> - If God wanted us to have money, he would give it to us
> - We don’t have a lot of money because we love our children
> - Having a lot of money will change you (into a bad person)
> - If I had a lot of money, my friends and family will look at me differently
> - If I have more money, I will have more worries and problems
> - There are less opportunities to make money nowadays

#### Debunking the Myths of Money

The truth is that many of these beliefs and attitudes that some people hold onto with much conviction are nothing but inaccurate generalizations and excuses that keep them from living a truly a happy and wealthy life. In order to truly align your mind to wealth creation, you must debunk these negative myths and really look at the facts...

Stick these new beliefs next to your workstation or paste them on your computer’s desktop and repeat them daily. When your subconscious begins to get flooded with all these new positive feelings about money, you will find yourself becoming a money magnet! With the conclusion of this chapter, let’s move on
to explore...

# II Cash Flow Strategies of the Rich

## 4 How the Rich Manage Cash Flow

### The Biggest Lie Ever Told About Wealth

Why is it that 90% of the population find it so difficult to become rich? It is because all of us have been told the greatest lie of all, the lie that has been keeping us from becoming rich. Before you can ever become wealthy, you must first discover the truth about wealth and remove the wool that has been pulled over your eyes for way too long.

Let me start off by asking you to do a simple exercise. I would like you to close your eyes and picture a millionaire in your mind. Picture the clothes the person is wearing, the car he drives, how he spends his money, how he spends his day and how he dines. Go ahead and do this NOW before you go onto the next paragraph.

Well, what picture came into your mind?

If you are like most people, you would have pictured a millionaire as someone who wears the latest, branded clothes, who drives the newest luxury car model, who spends lavishly, who dines in fine restaurants and spends on the priciest, choicest dishes and most superb wines.

You may have imagined someone who is relaxing in a cushy leather upholstered armchair in his mansion or yacht, puffing on his Havana cigar. Why is this so? It’s because of the way we have been brainwashed by television and movies to think this is the way millionaires live and spend their money. It is precisely these beliefs and habits that actually keep us from becoming wealthy!

The truth is that very few self-made millionaires live this way. In fact, the only ones who do live this indolent, self-indulgent lifestyle are the minority of millionaires who either inherited all their wealth or who made their money through sports or entertainment. And all of them usually have one thing in common. They inevitably end up losing everything within ten years. Their wealth is only temporary. Look at Mike Tyson, Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown and a whole list of other celebrities who made hundreds of millions within their careers. They are either all broke or heavily in debt today.

### The Truth About Wealth

In the New York Times Best-Selling book ‘The Millionaire Next Door’, Thomas J. Stanley interviewed 300 self-made American millionaires to find out how they think, how they earn their money and how they spend their wealth. What he discovered was a shocking revelation that made his book an instant best-seller.

It was discovered that many people who had high paying jobs, drove the latest luxury cars and wore the latest designer clothes and who appeared to be have millions to spend, were usually broke with a low personal net worth. Most of these professionals and senior executives of multi-national companies were what he termed ‘Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAW)’.

In contrast, those who were actual millionaires (that is those with a net worth of over US$1 million) lived very frugally and well below their means. Eighty-percent of them were born poor or from middle class families. They wore inexpensive suits and never bought a watch that cost more than S$500. Most of them drove secondhand cars, never bought the latest models of vehicles and they usually invested a minimum of 20% of their income in the stock market or private businesses. He termed these people ‘Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW)’.

I must admit that when I was much younger, I too had the same distorted beliefs about how real millionaires lived. When I was a kid, I used to admire and envy people who drove the latest Porsche
Boxsters and who lived in Penthouses and lived lavish lifestyles. My millionaire Dad (who never bought a brand new car in his life until he turned 50), used to tell me that these people were in reality quite broke and it was really the bank who owned their houses and their fleet of cars. He said that they were one paycheck away from going broke. I never really understood what he meant until much later on in my life.

### The True Definition of Wealth

Before you can be truly wealthy, you must first know what wealth really means. Again, many people think that a person’s wealth is defined by how much he earns, by the clothes he wears, by the house he lives in and by the way he lives. We now know that this is not at all true.

A person’s wealth is actually defined by how long a period of time he/she can sustain their lifestyle if they stop working. The longer you can go on living your life without working another day, the richer you actually are. Your wealth is therefore defined by three things: (1)your monthly expenses, (2)your liquid assets and (3)your passive income.

Your liquid assets refer to how much cash or cash equivalents (like stocks, bonds & fixed deposits) you have to pay for your monthly expenses. Your passive income refers to income that you will continue to receive even after you stop working. This could include interest, dividends, royalties and profits from a business.

Let’s look at an example. Steve is a director in a multi-national company and earns a $20,000 monthly salary. He lives a lavish lifestyle that results in personal and household expenses a month of $18,000. He hasn’t really saved much over the years as he has spent any surplus upgrading his house and car. His liquid assets are just under $18,000. Besides his full time job, he has no other sources of income. What is Steve’s level of wealth? Well, if he stops working today, his $18,000 will last him for just a month. So his wealth is
one month’s salary. As you can see, wealth is defined not by the absolute amount of dollars, but by time.

On the other hand, Susan, a marketing manager in a retail store earns a monthly salary of $5,000 a month but she is much wealthier than Steve. How is this so? Well, over the last 20 years, Susan has
diligently saved 20% of her income and invested it in the right stocks and mutual funds that have given her returns of 15% per year. (You are going to learn how to achieve this return with minimal risk in the later chapters).

Over the years, Susan’s liquid assets have grown to $1.32 million (you can verify this with a financial calculator). In addition, she has spent her free time building up a home-based business that sells unique collectibles over the Internet. Her small business earns her an additional income of $1300 a month. She may not drive a fancy car or wear a Cartier watch, but let’s see what her wealth is.

If Susan were to stop working today, she would still retain the $1,300 monthly passive income that her home-based business earns her. Since her monthly expenses total $4,000 a month (80% of her income), she would have a net outflow of $2,700 a month. With her $1.32 million in accumulated savings, she would be able to survive for 40 years! (This is assuming that she does not invest the $1.32 million she has prudently saved up!).

If Susan were to put her $1.32 million into a risk-free fixed deposit account earning interest of 4%, it would bring her an additional interest of $52,800 per annum. This means another source of passive income that rakes in $4,400 a month. So you can see how Susan can very comfortably go on forever without working another day in her life!

Can you now see that your wealth (i.e net worth) is not determined by how much you earn, rather, it is determined by how much you save and wisely invest. Even with just a middle class income, you could become a millionaire if you have enough financial intelligence, discipline and patience.

### How Wealthy Are You Now?

Before you can achieve your financial dreams, you must first know where you are right now. So, it is very important that you do a simple calculation to find out your current level of wealth. It may be a painful and even discouraging process to some people, but it is absolutely necessary – if you don’t want creditors pounding at your door! So, take five minutes to complete this exercise before moving on.

So, the key to increasing your personal wealth is to reduce your expenses, create sources of passive income and invest your money to massively increase your liquid asset base. How do you do this? First you must understand...

>
> *401K is a type of employer sponsored retirement savings plan for United States citizens.*

### How the Rich Manage their Cash Flow

Once again, the key difference that sets people apart in their ability to create wealth is not just how much they earn but more importantly, how they manage the cash that flows through their hands. The rich
manage their money very differently from the average Joe. They have a very different set of habits in the areas of saving, investing and cash spending. To become a millionaire, you must learn and adopt the cash flow management habits of the rich.

You have to first understand the concept of an ‘asset’ and the fact that some assets help you accumulate wealth while some other assets reduce your wealth. Assets are physical or intangible items that you own. They can be classified into Positive Cash Flow Assets (Assets Cash+) or Negative Cash Flow Assets (Assets Cash-). Sometimes to purchase an asset like a house or a car, you have to take a loan from the bank. When we borrow money, we incur a liability. As you know, liabilities incur the extra expense of interest payments you must make.

Positive Cash Flow Assets (Assets Cash+) are assets that provide you with positive cash flow and/or capital appreciation even after deducting interest expenses from liabilities incurred. Examples are stocks, bonds, profitable small businesses, properties with positive yield, intellectual property, fixed deposits and so on.

Negative Cash Flow Assets (Assets cash-) are those that depreciate in value and/or incur additional expenses such as maintenance or interest payments for liabilities incurred. For example, if you bought a house and rented it out for $2,000 a month but had to pay a mortgage interest of $2,200, it would be a negative cash flow asset. A house which you buy to live in, or a car which is purchased for personal use will obviously not generate any form of income. They only incur negative cash fl ow and should be considered as Negative Cash Flow Assets.

Bearing this in mind, let’s see how the poor, middle class and the rich manage their cash. Although the use of income statements and balance sheets have been around for hundreds of years, Robert Kiyosaki (author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad) first illustrated it in way that made it easy for people to understand how cash flow was managed by the different income groups. In my illustration below, I use a slightly different approach.

#### Cash Flow Management of the Poor

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-15_15-17-15.png)

Those with the poor mindset are usually made up of blue-collar workers and junior executives. They tend to spend whatever they earn. They live for the moment without sparing much thought for the future. They are driven by the need for instant gratification. They save little or nothing with the excuse that they earn too little to save. Even if they get a pay raise, they will spend the surplus just as quickly. As a result, they have no financial stability or security. Some continue to work in a job they loathe because they have to keep working to pay the bills. The moment they lose their job or suffer a pay cut, they find it very difficult to survive. It is obvious that this habit of managing cash will never help you get rich.

#### Cash Flow Management of the Middle Class

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-15_15-35-08.png)

Those with the middle class mindset are usually made up of professionals, middle and senior executives with larger paychecks. They adopt the very common habit of ‘earn, spend and save’. After
deducting their monthly expenses from their incomes, they will save the difference. The trouble is that they tend to use these savings to buy a lot more negative cash flow assets as compared to positive cash flow assets. They use their hard earned savings to buy a bigger house and a bigger car which all come with bigger loans, bigger monthly payments and bigger expenses.

They buy the latest home entertainment systems on credit and max out their credit cards. As a result, there is no additional cash inflow but a lot more cash outflow. For this reason, most middle class families appear to be wealthy, but have very low or even negative net worth. Although their houses and cars may be worth millions, they also owe millions, leaving very little equity.

They have in fact, even less financial stability or security. If they lose their jobs or suffer a pay cut, they will end up with huge loans, large monthly expenses and deep in debt. Many of these people suffer high financial pressure, working hard every month for the bank. They cannot afford to quit or lose their jobs and
find themselves well and truly caught in the rat race. As a result, they will have to work hard for the rest of their lives, hope they do not become seriously ill and will pay the ultimate price when they find that they can never retire.

#### Cash Flow Management of the Rich

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-15_15-25-21.png)

So how do the rich manage their money? How do they achieve a level of wealth where they do not have to work if they choose not to? Those with the wealthy mindset adopt a ‘earn, save and spend’ habit of managing their cash. They set a specific target of how much they want to save every month, usually 15%-20%. They deduct this savings from the income they earn and spend the rest.

Unlike those with the ‘middle class mentality’, the rich mindset motivates them to take their savings and invest in Positive Cash Flow Assets that will generate returns and appreciate in value. They would
rather put their money in carefully selected stocks, mutual funds and businesses than to splurge on the latest LCD Plasma Television. Although they may buy a few luxuries to pamper themselves, their Positive cash flow assets far outweigh their Negative Cash Flow Assets. As a result, the additional passive income generated from their investments outweighs whatever expenses they incur on these ‘extras’.

They continue to diligently save and invest until their Positive Cash Flow Assets begin to generate sufficient cash flow to meet and even exceed their monthly expenses. When this is achieved, they are at a level of financial freedom where they can choose to stop working and sustain their current lifestyle indefinitely. This is the level that you must aim to attain within the next few years. With the strategies and techniques you will learn in the coming chapters, you will find that it is indeed a definite reality within your grasp! So, the secrets of the rich can be summarized as follows...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-15_15-30-18.png)

An important thing to know is that it doesn’t always take money to create Positive Cash Flow Assets. In chapters 8 and 9, you will learn that from the ideas in your head, you can generate powerful cash flow assets that generate multiple streams of passive income with little or no investment. Now that you know what you must do to achieve ultimate wealth, it is time to get into the specifics of how you are going to do it. The next chapter will be focused on helping you developing a specific plan to achieve the four levels of wealth. Let’s begin...

## 5 The Four Levels of Wealth

Sit up straight. Take a deep breath and get ready to engage your mind. Why? Because this short chapter is loaded with activities and exercises that will get you to understand and craft a powerful personal financial plan that will help you reach your goal of true wealth. It’s a destination which, when you get there, you’ll have the option, the freedom, of never having to work (for money) for another day of your life!

Some of these exercises may seem tedious and time-consuming. You may even have to dig up a lot of old bank statements, receipts and income tax returns but it is absolutely necessary that you push yourself and commit to completing every exercise here. This chapter is focused on showing you the specific mechanics of how you can eventually reach your goal of financial abundance.

### Taking Stock: Where Are You Now?

In the last chapter, I got you to do a rough calculation on your current level of wealth. However, in order to develop an effective financial road map, you must first determine your specific financial situation. You must complete what I call your ‘Financial Report Card’.

When we were back in school we were all assessed by the number of ‘A’s that appeared on our school report card. Much emphasis was placed on those ‘A’s as they were the measure of our success. Similarly, all companies have quarterly and yearly report cards called financial statements that tell the shareholders how successful the company is doing. Well, preparing your ‘Financial Report Card’ will enable you to find out how successful you are at creating wealth.

Your ‘Financial Report Card’ is made up of your ‘Personal Balance Sheet’ and your ‘Personal Income Statement’. Let’s explore them right now.

### Your Personal Balance Sheet

Your Personal Balance Sheet shows your financial strength and stability at a specific point in time. It tells you how much you own (your assets), how much you owe (your liabilities) and how much is left over when you have deducted what you owe from what you own (your net worth). Your net worth is the traditional measure of your wealth. In other words your Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth (Similarly, Net Worth = Assets – Liabilities).

So right now, I want you to spend a couple of minutes to complete your personal balance sheet the table below.

If you have access to a computer, I suggest you key in the figures into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (or any other spreadsheet application), so you can do updates easily. You can download a ready-made template from my resource website at www.adam-khoo.com/bizandmoneytips.html and go to the section
under ‘Free Business and Money-Making Downloads’.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/Snipaste_2020-03-15_15-51-49.png)

> *CPF is a compulsory savings plan for Singapore citizens and 401 (k) is a type of employer-sponsored retirement savings plan for United States citizens.*

You’ve completed your Personal Balance Sheet. Good, now you have a true picture of your **current level of wealth**. Although it may feel good owning assets worth $800,000, if you have a jumbo mortgages and loans of $720,000, you are really only worth $80,000. A sobering thought.

Are your assets a lot more than your liabilities or is the reverse true? As you take a look at your Balance Sheet, take note of whether you have more Positive Cash Flow Assets (rich mentality) or a lot more Negative Cash Flow Assets (middle class mentality).

Once you have done up your Balance Sheet, you should update it every six months with the goal of **Increasing your assets** (especially the positive cash flow ones), **Reducing your liabilities** and hence **Increasing your net worth**.

### Personal Income Statement

This is the second section of your financial report card. Your personal income statement will tell you how much you are earning (income), how much you are spending (expenses), and how much you have left over to save and invest over a particular period of time (one month, a few months or one year).

First, fill in all your sources of income. Your income is divided into two categories: active and passive. Most people have a single source of active income (usually their salary) and no passive income sources.

Next, fill in all your annual expenses. Your expenses are categorized into personal (include donations here), children, housing and transport. Take your average monthly expenses (this month) and multiply it by 12 months to get an estimation of your total annual income.

Finally, deduct your total expenses from your total income to get your annual savings. Again, if you have a computer, key the data into an excel spreadsheet. Again, you can also download this ready-made template from www.adam-khoo.com/bizandmoneytips.html. Go ahead and do this exercise now.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dolkra/pic-hosting/master/img/20200315160041.png)

With your completed annual income statement, you can then begin to plan based on the rate of your current savings. First, how long will it take you to reach your financial goals? At the same time, you can begin to see where you are spending your money and how to control your expenses. Your objective is also to work towards filling up the entire income section so that you will have multiple streams of active and passive income.

Besides an annual statement, you must also create a monthly statement that you can update at the end of each month. A sample is attached for your reference. This monthly template is also included in the free download section from my website.

### The Four Levels of Wealth

Now that you know where you are financially, you must know exactly where you want to be. In order to achieve your financial dreams, you must first identify specific levels of wealth that are achievable and attainable. There are basically four levels of wealth you must aim to attain.

#### Level 1: Financial Stability

The first level of wealth is known as financial stability. This is the most basic level of wealth that you must first attain.

**You have achieved Financial Stability when:**

1. You have accumulated enough liquid assets to cover your current expenses for a minimum of six months.
2. In addition, you have life and hospitalization insurance to protect you and/or your family’s lifestyle should you be permanently disabled, unable to work or if you pass away suddenly.

When you have attained this first level, you will have the peace of mind that should any unexpected challenges befall you (like retrenchment, business failure, pay cut, death or disability), you and your family’s lifestyle will not be compromised. Or worse, you or your family will not slide into debt.

Attaining this first level will also ensure that you or your family will have adequate time to look for new sources of income to put you back on track. At the same time, you will also have the financial stability to quit your job and invest your time to build a business, should you need to.

Once you have achieved this, you must then aim to achieve...

#### Level 2: Financial Security

You have achieved Financial Security when you have through the investment of time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to cover your MOST BASIC expenses. In other words, when you reach this level, you can stop working and maintain a very basic lifestyle. It also means that if you continue working, all your active income can be channeled towards your investments and this will further compound your assets and increase your income streams.

So, what are your most basic expenses? What necessities must you spend on to live a very simple lifestyle? Well, this is subjective but generally your basic expenses should include no more than the following:

1. House mortgage and related expenses such as utilities and conservancy fees.
2. Public Transportation expense.
3. Food for you and your family (household groceries).
4. All Interest payments for debts owed.
5. All Insurance premiums including life, disability and home.

Of course, we shouldn’t be satisfied at being at this level. Once accomplished, you must then aim to go for...

#### Level 3: Financial Freedom

Many of us have heard of the dream of achieving financial freedom but what does it really mean? Well, Financial Freedom is when you have through the investment of time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain your CURRENT LIFESTYLE.

When you reach this level of Financial Freedom, you can choose to stop working and still maintain your current standard of living... indefinitely! In reality, most people who achieve financial freedom love their work so much that they continue working not because they have to, but because they choose to. I can tell
you from personal experience that it is a great feeling to have...being free of financial pressure & worries and working purely out of passion!

Obviously, the more expenses you have now, the more luxurious and indulgent your standard of living, the longer it will take for you to achieve financial freedom. So besides increasing your passive income, reducing your unnecessary/frivolous expenses will accelerate your way towards this fourth level. Finally, you must aim to achieve...

#### Level 4: Financial Abundance

So what is the ultimate level of wealth you can achieve? Financial Abundance is when you have through the investment of time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain your DESIRED LIFESTYLE.

Your desired lifestyle is the amount of monthly expenses it will take for you to live the life of your dreams. This is totally subjective depending on the lifestyle that you desire. If your desired lifestyle is to live in a 20,000 square-feet bungalow with a swimming pool, send your kids to the best schools and drive a Mercedes Benz S-Class, then you could be looking at a monthly lifestyle that’ll cost a cool $50,000. Of course the more luxurious your desired lifestyle, the longer it will take for you to achieve financial abundance.

The moment you reach the level of Financial Abundance, you will be able to choose to stop working and live your dream lifestyle indefinitely. Again, most people who do reach this level usually love what they do so much that they keep on working for fun, channeling 100% of their active income towards charitable causes and further compounding their wealth. With the right strategies and plans in place, you too will be able to achieve this ultimate level of wealth.

### My Personal Strategy to Achieve Financial Security
So, how do you accumulate positive cash fl ow assets that generate the passive income you need to cover your basic expenses? In the coming chapters, you will learn how to create a whole range of cash generating assets. Some of these assets like stocks, businesses, bonds, fixed deposits and mutual funds require the investment of money to generate a return.

However, you do not always require lots of capital to generate passive income. You will learn that you can build cash generating cash flow assets like intellectual property and home-based businesses that require ideas and time, but very little capital.

Right now, I want you to fill in your current level of passive income (for most people, this figure is normally a couple of hundred dollars of interest from the bank) and your targeted passive income
to achieve financial security.

Next, you must brainstorm and think of all the positive cash flow assets you must accumulate, the amount of investment needed, the estimated return and the passive income that will be generated.
The total passive income generated should cover your basic monthly expenses.

As we have not yet covered the strategies on how to achieve this, you don’t have to complete this right now. We shall come back to this page after you have completed the first 19 chapters, and you will be more than ready to develop your plan!

Here is an example, of how you can complete this financial plan.

> *Note that although stocks and mutual funds are positive cash flow assets that can give you a return of 13%-25% a year, we do not include them here as the returns are capital appreciation and not cash returns.*

As you can see, different cash flow assets give you different rates of returns and while some require lots of capital, others require mainly the investment of time and ideas. For example, if you were to rely purely on high yielding bonds of 8% return, you will need $600,000 to generate $48,000 a year ($48,000 ÷ 8%) in passive income (i.e. $4,000 a month). If you were to create a home-based Internet business, a $2,300 investment could through time and hard work, generate you a monthly $4,000 cash flow. Stay tuned on how you can possibly do this in the coming section on ‘Creating Multiple Streams of Income Online’.
